📝 Secured TODO App – React Native (Bare) + Expo Local Authentication
📌 Overview

This project implements a secured TODO list application using a Bare React Native + Expo workflow, where all critical state mutations (Add / Update / Delete) are protected using device-level authentication.

Authentication is enforced using the Expo Local Authentication module, ensuring that users must verify their identity before modifying the TODO list.

🔐 Authentication Strategy

All TODO mutations are protected using:

Biometric Authentication (Fingerprint / Face)

Device Credentials (PIN / Pattern / Password fallback)

Instead of enforcing authentication at the UI layer, authentication is implemented at the service layer, ensuring that:

State mutation cannot bypass authentication

Business logic remains platform-safe

Security is enforced regardless of UI interaction

Mutation Flow:

UI → Secure Service → Auth Guard → Redux Dispatch → Reducer Mutation


This approach ensures enterprise-grade mutation protection.

🧱 Architecture

The application follows a Feature-First Modular Architecture with clear separation of concerns:

src
 ┣ app (Redux Store)
 ┣ core
 ┃ ┣ auth (Biometric Service)
 ┃ ┣ guard (Mutation Guard)
 ┃ ┗ storage (Secure Storage Wrapper)
 ┣ features
 ┃ ┗ todo
 ┃    ┣ slice
 ┃    ┣ service
 ┃    ┣ persistence
 ┃    ┗ screen
 ┣ navigation
 ┗ hooks

Layer	Responsibility
UI	Presentation only
Service	Auth-protected mutation
Guard	Authentication enforcement
Reducer	Pure state mutation
Storage	Secure encrypted persistence
🗂 State Management

Redux Toolkit is used for:

Predictable mutation flow

Scalable state management

Middleware-friendly architecture

Testable async logic

Reducers are kept pure with all side effects handled in the service layer.

🔒 Secure Persistence

TODOs are securely persisted using:

expo-secure-store


This ensures:

Encrypted storage using Android Keystore / iOS Keychain

Protection against plaintext storage

Secure state rehydration on app restart

Persistence Flow:

Redux State → Serialize → SecureStore
App Launch → Load → Rehydrate Redux

🧪 Unit Testing

Unit tests are implemented using:

Jest

jest-expo

The authentication service is mocked during testing to:

Avoid dependency on native modules

Isolate business logic

Validate mutation dispatch after authentication

Tested:

Auth-protected mutation service

📦 Third Party Modules Used
Module	Purpose
expo-local-authentication	Device-level authentication
expo-secure-store	Encrypted storage
@reduxjs/toolkit	State management
react-navigation	Navigation
jest-expo	Unit testing
🚀 Running the Project

Install dependencies:

npm install


Run Android:

npx expo start


Run Tests:

npm test

📌 Notes

Device-level authentication supports both biometric verification and device credentials fallback, ensuring compatibility across devices without biometric enrollment.
